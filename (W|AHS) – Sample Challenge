Web Application Hacking and Security (W|AHS) – Sample Challenge Set

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> The following challenges are provided **for educational purposes only** to illustrate the *types of lab tasks* that learners may encounter in web application security training (e.g., W|AHS).  
> They must only be attempted in **authorized lab environments** such as HackTheBox, VulnHub, local VMs, or official EC-Council labs.  
> Do **not** attempt these activities on real systems or without permission.

## Challenge 1 (CMS Basics)
1. Identify a valid username to access the admin console of a CMS in a lab environment.  
2. Identify a valid password to access the CMS admin console.  
3. Locate a `flag.txt` file on the target web server (lab) and record its content.

## Challenge 2 (eCommerce Website)
1. Identify the login page of the target eCommerce site (URL path after the base address).  
2. Locate a `user.txt` file on the web server (lab).  
3. Locate a `Root.txt` file on the web server (lab).  

---

## Challenge 3 (CMS Exploitation)
1. Identify a valid username for the CMS admin console in a web application lab.  
2. Identify a valid password for the CMS admin console.  
3. Exploit the lab application to locate a `root.txt` file on the server.

## Challenge 4 (System Compromise)
1. Compromise a lab machine at IP `$ip` and determine the username associated with UID 1001.  
2. Locate a `flag.txt` file on the lab machine.  

---

## Challenge 5 (Parameter Tampering)
1. Perform reconnaissance on a lab target at `$ip` and identify the encoding used for a URL parameter `ID`.  
2. Decode the parameter to determine the admin user’s account ID.  
3. Find the SSN (6-digit format) from the admin profile in the lab system.  

---

## Challenge 6 (WordPress Login)
1. Identify the CMS admin account and its password in a WordPress lab environment.  
2. Retrieve the contents of a `user.txt` file from the target application (lab).  
3. Retrieve the contents of a `root.txt` file from the target application (lab).  

---

## Challenge 7 (Password Hashing & Login)
1. Identify a valid username in the web application (lab).  
2. Determine the password hashing algorithm used by the application.  
3. Use the username to log in and obtain the value of `flag.txt` from the welcome page.  

---

## Challenge 8 (CMS + Privilege Escalation)
1. Identify the CMS admin account and password in the lab system.  
2. Identify another user account on the application.  
3. Retrieve the contents of a `user.txt` file from the lab server.  
4. Retrieve the contents of a `root.txt` file from the lab server.

## ✅ Ethical Reminder
- These challenges are **examples only**, representing the *style* of tasks from web application security labs.  
- They are not real targets and should **never** be applied outside of controlled training environments.  
- Always follow **responsible and legal cybersecurity practices**.
