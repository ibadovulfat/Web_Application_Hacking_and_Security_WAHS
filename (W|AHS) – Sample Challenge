## ✅ Conceptual Notes
- Focus on **learning the concepts** behind authentication, authorization, and web resource access.  
- Perform exercises **only in controlled lab environments** (virtual machines, lab platforms).  
- Avoid referencing any real exam content or sensitive real-world data.  
- Use these exercises to **practice analysis, enumeration, and safe testing methods**.
